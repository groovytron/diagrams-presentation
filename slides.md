# Diagram Types

- Sequence diagram
- Usecase diagram
- Class diagram
- Object diagram

# Diagram Types

- Activity diagram
- Component diagram
- Deployment diagram
- State diagram
- Timing diagram

# What are diagrams for ?

- Document/prototype architecture
  - Common language to specify implementations
- System(s) to system(s) interactions
- User to system(s) interactions

# What are diagrams for ?

- Identify performances bottlenecks
- Identify sources of failure

# Issues

- Not everybody likes documenting
  - boring
  - too much time to write
  - too much time to maintain

# Approach

- **Use the right level of abstraction and details**

# The C4 Model

- Based on UML
- Lean
- Decompose system into containers and components

# C4 levels:

1. **context diagrams**: user - systems relations
2. **container diagrams**: system is decomposed in multiple containers representing applications or data store
3. **component diagrams**: containers are decomposed into components
4. **code diagrams**

# Examples

```js
```
